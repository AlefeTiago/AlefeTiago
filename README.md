**Abstract:** 

Building Technician from Fundação Indaiatubana de Educação e Cultura (FIEC) and Undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at Campinas State University (UNICAMP). I worked as an intern at the Secretariat of Works and Public Roads (SEMOP - Indaiatuba) from 2017 -2018. I also worked as an intern at BTG Pactual Bank (Prototype - CTB) in 2021. Currently I am researching low orbit satellites with a scholarship from an agreement between Idea! and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ). Skilled in C++, Machine Language like AVR for PIC and ATmega328P, Python (Programming Language), Standart Query Language (SQL), MATLAB, Java, HTML, MS Excel, MS Project, AutoCad, Revit (BIM Technology), and TeamWork.

**Talking about Personal Stuffs:** 

- I’m currently learning about Simulink and discrete event simulation;
- Fields I enjoy the most include energy, wireless networks and signal processing.
- Formal music education since eleven yOld
- Interested in data science 

**Talking about Work Experience:** 

- I worked in the Prototype - CTB (Change de Bank Program) team developing process automation tools to facilitate the routine operations of the Middle Office team (RJ). During the summer internship program I made two major contributions to the team: an automation conveyor with a visual interface for different areas of the bank to approve and reject submissions and an automatic spreadsheet generator for customer registration in the bank's internal systems. Both projects consumed large databases and had web screens as interface, so for the Back End development I used Standard Query Language (SQL), and Python (Pandas, Numpy, Camelot) and for the Front End development I used Flask, HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

- I also worked helping the engineers of the Secretariat of Works and Public Roads (SEMOP) to design, budget, monitor and deliver infrastructure projects for the city of Indaiatuba. The projects involved State and Federal agencies, as they came from the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC - started in 2007 by the Federal Government). Therefore, the veracity and reproducibility of the data presented was of utmost importance. During my internship period I worked directly with computer aided design software (AutoCad and SketchUP) and management software such as Excel and MSProject.

- Nowadays i'm a Researcher at the Digital Communications Laboratory (ComLab) , focusing on the study of low
Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (altitudes up to 2000 km). Under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Darli Augusto de Arruda Mello.
